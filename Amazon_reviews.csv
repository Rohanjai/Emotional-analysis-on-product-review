0,Subhash K.,Waste of money.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Over priced. And without charger too.Not recommended. It is a waste of money. Be logical enough to make a call on this.
1,Aakash,This took one of my kidneys and a testicle. But worth it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Impressed! I‚Äôve tested it with iphone11 and other iphones, it‚Äôs remarkable. It has unquestionably better video quality and touch sensitivity. The screen is bigger than I thought. I loved the Gold variant. But if u have a 11 max or a X max I wouldn‚Äôt suggest for an upgradation. I feel that the next iphone will have way more cooler features so wouldn‚Äôt hurt to wait. My previous iphone was 6, so in my case am totally peachy with this phone. Though it has a ceramic glass wouldn‚Äôt hurt to buy a screen guard. If u can afford it u can totally go 4 it."
2,Arjun Menon,The best iPhone in 2020. Phone of the year.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the best iPhone yes. The Max model gives you the better screen and overall is a camera beast. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Regarding value for money, its sad that we live in a country where Falling Rupee, Import Duty and High GST are the reasons for such high poricing. A rich country like USA pays only $1099 (Rs. 81,500) whereas its priced a whopping Rs. 48,400 more in India. Thats slmost 60% more. Shame!"
3,Amazon Customer,"Massive Display, Monster Camera! üëåüèΩ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros: Great display, battery, cameras, usability, ease of access & a whole lot moreCons: Running out of Kidneys to sell to buy iPhones in India üòì"
4,Sahith,Best & Biggest iPhone i ever owned ü•∞,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just no words, what a beauty. Upgrading from iPhone X, this feels so big and heavy. But do not has much discomfort while using, you will get used to it.Make sure to get a decent Screen guard and clear case just to safeguard this beauty."
5,Naval,This is a pretty monster you must have!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Had pre booked this iPhone 12 Pro Max. Amazon delivered it promptly within four days of launch. Kudos to thisclightening fast delivery.Now about device, Since I upgraded from 11, I could notice the difference between A13 and A14 speed. Miraculously faster. Performance wise this indeed is a notch up.Build quality is significantly improved. This design which Apple brought back from iPhone 5 series is absolutely lovely!  These two factors give it a classy and stylish look combined with solid and durable finish. The phone does feels premium when one holds it. All the more reasons to go ga-ga about this pretty beast!Phone is indeed pricey but if one can shell these bucks; you should not blink your eye before buying. The upgrade does provide you with enhanced durability, performance and looks!"
6,Mitul,Expensive but honestly saying great phone...,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I fell like the phone is bit expensive then it really should be but it's an Apple what can you say thay always one step ahead from ther competitors in terms of pricing..thay also took the charger this time to making more profit out of it..less carbon footprint my ass...but honestly saying accept the price the phone look nice and also fill good in hand not so heavy as i thought.... Display is nice but not as nice as oneplus flagship models... In terms of performance and camera quality iphone still batter then any other phone that available in the market..
7,Brain Craftsman,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! ü•∞,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Real beast! Its such a treat! All the wait was worth. Upgraded to pro max from iphone x after 2 years. Things have really changed a lot. Camera quality is awesome, night mode is unbelievably good and the best of all...is battery life. After spending whole day with heavy usage, its still about half. Using it with spigen cover and screen guard. Very happy with this new purchase. Using jio main sim with airtel e sim. Both are working smoothly."
8,Rajesh Nambiar,Phone call get disconnected all the time,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone call get disconnected all the time
9,Mohit Kumar,Pathetic Apple Experience,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The phone crashed within 5 days of purchase. And is lying dead ever since.
10,Sunshine,iPhone Pro Max - the worst display screen on an iPhone yet. With a hefty price tag,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Apple claims that the display screen is the brightest yet. But when I compare it with my XS MAX, the iPhone pro Max is distinctly yellowish and not as bright. There is definitely a problem with the new Apple phones - BUYER BEWARE!May 29-2021This same phone that I bought from Amazon 3.5 months ago has completely stopped working now. When I tried to reboot the phone after charging it refused to turn back on. And now there is a faint flicker of the apple logo and then completely black. It‚Äôs as good as an expensive paperweight now. Does anyone have any idea what to do? Whether apple will replace this phone ? Does anyone else have problems like this with their very expensive iPhone 12 Pro Max"
11,Mangal Kundu,(256 GB)- Graphite,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best!! I am a new user of iphone..It‚Äôs great for me and so impressed..If you use android old version, you needs to use iPhone for one time..I fell in love with it after using it for the first time ‚ù§Ô∏è"
12,Ca Yagnesh Desai Mumbai,Adapter is missing ..Why is this? Is this policy of Apple or Amazon? Kindly reply at the earliest.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Apple Phone is not activated even after one hour. Guys I suggest if you intend to buy such an expensive gadgetavoid buying online.
13,Sherry,üëç,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a beast (except for the price which is really high as usual), can't wait for it to launch!"
14,shireesha reddy,Apple wont accept the macro defect,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Apple is exploiting people by selling overpriced products.But all iphone 12 pro MAXs are incapable Of taking macro photos this is a known limitationAnd there are threads going on Apple‚Äôs website regarding this I don‚Äôt know why no one has Reported this issue yet. but Apple is not willing to accept this as a manufacturing defect or a hardware issue and still wont accept it. and it is not fixable through software updates.Apple Support team told me that this is a feature of Apple to 12 pro Max. Not sure how a defect could be feature even 12 pro or any other Chinese phones will be able to take macro photos Apple support still doesn‚Äôt accept this as an issue. we need a resolution
15,Ajay Singh,Bad service,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone came seal opened
16,Babita,Overheating. 10 min and shuts down. Torch not working and more...,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone overheats within 10 min of Whatsapp call. So much that it is hard to keep it in hand. Then it shows phone overheating sign and shuts down. Torch is not working in my phone. It looks old as well. Don‚Äôt throw your money because if you talk to customer care they will ask you to go to an Apple store and get some report. This report will then be submitted to Amazon. In COVID times it‚Äôs very difficult. Customer support or helpline isn‚Äôt working that this store gives. They will ask you to sort this out on your own. Beware.
17,Amazon Customer,Pathetic and not value for money,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The phone has no charger and earphone also it was not mentioned anywhere in your product details. You should not hide these information when u are selling such high value product. Who takes phone without charger?? I would have never purchased this online would have taken it from iPhone store and would have made sure that I get charger . Anywhere in the world a new phone never comes without charger. I bought twice from Dubai and also in Mumbai same apple iPhone and never faced this issue. So I will rate my experience as pathetic and not satisfied.
18,Dr. Amol Andhale,Just excellent,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†Apple‚Äôs latest flagship makes useful advances over its predecessor in almost every way. Image quality is very good, autofocus is lightning fast and accurate, detail is high, and colors are generally pleasant. Apple remains a leader in preview performance, so what you see when composing a shot looks a lot like the final result. Dynamic range could be better, but mobile photographers should be pleased overall.This iPhone‚Äôs weakest link is its lack of long zoom capability, something we‚Äôre seeing more of in flagships from the competition. If reach is paramount to you, then there are other phones that excel in this metric (but none that run iOS).Video performance overall is excellent, just short of the best we‚Äôve seen. Wide dynamic range, good color, low noise, and effective stabilization make this iPhone a good choice for users who prioritize video capabilities.For mobile photographers committed to the iOS ecosystem and ready to part with the hefty purchase price, the iPhone 12 Pro Max shouldn‚Äôt disappoint."
19,Rina,Currently the best phone Apple makes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the ‚Äòall we can do‚Äô offering of iPhone from Apple in 2020. The phone runs smooth and fast, as expected. A14 Bionic crushes everything you can throw at it with it keeping apps open in the background with zero issues. The battery lasts all day. The camera is amazing and it‚Äôs quite a big improvement coming from an iPhone 7 Plus. The screen is vibrant and the speakers sound like a good quality Bluetooth speaker. The pacific blue color is beautiful as well. Looks like grey in certain lighting. However, since this is the biggest iPhone Apple has ever made, I would recommend holding the phone in person before buying as this phone is huge & some people can find it uncomfortable at 6.7 inches. Many people can get 90% of what this phone offers in the smaller 12 Pro. That being said, if you want the biggest screen, the biggest battery on an iPhone and as long as you know what you‚Äôre getting into with the size, and you have the money to spend, would recommend this phone 10/10."
20,Puneet,Spending lakhs in defect piece don‚Äôt take online,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Defect piece‚Ä¶ never buy expensive products from online
21,Prasant,MIND BLOWING,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great sound , great display and camera. Mind blowing design .... Superb .....loved it .."
22,Subhojit Misra,Sab ka baap hai,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It is like a best of the best. Camera quality is amazing with raw capture capability. Now i feel lethargic of using my dslr and changing lens. Also can modify raw photos and post it same time using lightroom from iphone. Video quality is best and no other phone can beat it. I am not a gamer so cannot comment on performance from that aspect. But each application runs flawlessly including video editing one.But from price point of view it is tooooooo much. It is like a status statement that yea I am owner of a pro max.Anyway I am happy of my purchase and it is a usefull gadget for sure if one can afford it
23,Vishvendra,Value for kidney,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great phone and also lived upto its brand value expectations, although its difficult to live on just 1 kidney but no regrets.üòëüòë"
24,Biswajit Das,No value of money.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  iPhone just become bad quality day by day. Only good is there IOS. I don‚Äôt see any other point to use iPhone if they don‚Äôt have IOS.
25,Amazon Customer,Excellent all round performer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well, integration with MacBook Pro. (Apple ecosystem)Highly recommended business phone. (Security and Privacy feature)I am a lifelong Android user, After a thorough review finally decided to go with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max instead of Note 20 Ultra"
26,Christopher,in the Apple Store descriptions  it write to support 2 sim card. now only one,3.0 out of 5 stars,  dislike
27,Avesh,"major issue , need replacement",1.0 out of 5 stars,  wifi is not getting disconnected immd after connection. need replacement urgently
28,Sachin mahajan,Worst apple phone ..,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst phone by apple.. after 6 months battery goes down quickly.. after some systems updates.. camera photos..are blurry
29,Arsalan,Overpriced,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overpriced for nothing. People might get angry at me for saying this, but this is the one of the many reasons why people buy androids instead."
30,Amazon Customer,Defective product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Now I know why the seller was seeking the most costliest iPhone at a discount of Rs 10K. The iPhone is defective. The ringer volume just drops automatically to very low sound once a call is received. Sometimes the phone doesn‚Äôt even ring. Brand new iPhone, have been using only for the past 3 days. When you spent 1.2 lakhs on a phone and it doesn‚Äôt work properly, I kind of feel cheated. Didn‚Äôt expect this from seller which is a subsidiary of a company JV of Amazon and Amazon promotes it on its platform as no. 1 seller in India. Real shame and scam"

  ¬†Finally!! Upgraded from iPhone 7 Plus to this BEAST. Big Size, Longer Battery, Impressive Image Quality (specially 4K HDR Video) and the new A14 Bionic Chip is incredibly Fast!!!! Looks beautiful in Pacific Blue. Bought it for ‚Çπ1,29,000/- (Storage-256GB)Delivery & Handling- I ordered the device on 1st January and it was arrived on 6th January maybe due to non availability. But the worst part is that when the delivery guy came he could not hold the packet properly and dropped it accidentally on the road but product was packed well nothing went wrong.üôèüòÖBest iPhone i‚Äôve ever had!!!! üî•üî•It reminds me of my old iPhone 5S.If you‚Äôre still thinking to purchase it, just do it you‚Äôll never regret. ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è"
32,Vishal Agnihotri,Most luxury defining indulgence in a smartphone ever.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Enough has been said already about this phone. There are several reviews out there to help you decide whether or not to get this phone.I‚Äôd totally recommend this to anyone out there who‚Äôs looking for the best possible investment in a smartphone, considering money‚Äôs not an issue.That 1% of people who are going to buy this phone will get their money‚Äôs worth over a considerable amount of time.It delivers great real estate in terms of a huge display and bigger battery. Performance wise it‚Äôs a beast of a phone, with a much superior processor and chipset than it‚Äôs competition and predecessors. Delivering benchmark quality in every single aspect.So yeah, all in all an extremely worthy buy if you can afford that kind of money for a phone. Also, that Pacific Blue finish is by far the most elegant piece of art in a smartphone ever. Takes it to the next level in terms of look and feel. Luxury personified.10/10 recommend if you‚Äôve the pocket to afford it."
33,Abinash Pujahari,Shouldn‚Äôt have gone for gold one.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a beast. Slightly overpriced, as always. Please choose colours except gold. Everything else is good. Good camera quality even in low light. Need to test the 4K HDR video recording. Esim is working fine."
34,Souptik Bhattacharyya,THE BEST Phone That Money Can Buy ! (coming from an Android lover),5.0 out of 5 stars,"  We all heard rumors about several stuffs but at the end of the day iPhone 12 Pro Max manages to surprise me every now and then. Be it the built quality, application optimization, display, brightness, smoothness or even battery life. I have switched from Android to iPhone of late and the experience has been pretty good. The more secure platform gives you all that you need, to do serious business. You can do countless number of things on this device if you are features centric or specs oriented. Lastly, the camera module, as you all know, mqnages to deliver highest output if you want. I agree that many devices can have mind boggling numbers, bigger than this iPhone, on paper but having numbers and delivering results are two different aspects of it. If you are willing to spend this much amount of money, reliability factor comes into the picture.I was confused whether to buy Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or iPhone 12 Pro Max but at the end, I stick to my decision of buying iPhone 12 Pro Max. One of the very important reason of it being reliable. Buying an android might save you some bucks or even give you access to countless features but you have to think hard if you will be really needing those. I mean, don't get me wrong, we all have our own perspectives but coming from an hardcore Android lover, this opinion of mine should give you some broader view.I know that many think that Apple is little over hyped brand but let me tell you something, it will really amaze you when you actually buy one. This is my first iPhone and I am more than just happy with the product.Lastly, I should add one sentence to this review which is what you are trying to find all over the section.The question coming into your mind right now is if it is worth it.The answer is, absolutely YES ! It surely is WORTH IT.But, you won't know if you have never experienced such stuff. So, go for it if you are thinking hard as I did.Having an iPhone makes a whole lot of difference rather than owning an Android flagship. Android flagships lose their weight the moment next flagship is launched after a year or so, but if you are buying this phone, you can easily stick with it more than 5 years of timeframe or so what the device will start hinting you the moment you touch it.Trust me. I was an Android lover and has regretted previously buying phones those were not.But, the truth is that iPhones are not one of them and iOS is simply better optimized for user experience than Android. It is customer centric and not for business."
35,amitkarir,Absolutely awesome beast of a device,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome device. Total beast of a phone with a fat price tag but I love it and am totally satisfied, that‚Äôs what matters"

  ¬†There is nothing that you can like on it."
37,APEXELIN PRIVATE LIMITED,Good but,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Missing lots of feature if you come from Android otherwise good.The simplest review.
38,Jack,First time iphone user review - an Android user‚Äôs perspective,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First impression: Awesome product! I mean the hardware and the overall built quality, screen display, body material etc.Now the pain start when I need to migrate my backup of android phone. Eventually took the help of a paid app to migrate all my Whatsapp content without any hassle. Rest all the photos n videos have been migrated but in random order.Now coming from an android phone, I find that iOS has few limitation in terms of customisation and is very basic. Moreover, a simple process of checking and forwarding a message takes few more steps in iOS than in android, making a simple task complex. This makes me feel iOS is few years behind android in developing its UI. This is the only pain point I m currently facing. Moreover, most of apps that are free in android google play store are paid in apple app store and paid ones are even more costly for iOS.Now the highlight is obviously the camera. So far I have tested few night shots and boy!! am really impressed with the final outcome of the shots. One I have attached here for future buyers‚Äô reference. Portrait shots too are excellent. Ohh!! I forgot to mention about the inbuilt photo editing software of iOS. It has all the basic necessary tools to edit the photos then n there only. Recently, I have learned how to take a dreamy shot of waterfall with a Live camera option. Earlier that type of picture can be taken from a DSLR + ND filters on a tripod with long exposure shot. Now that shot can be taken handheld with this camera and boom!! you can make a dreamy long exposure shot in a matter of a second. Also downloaded few more editing apps such as Adobe PS express and Lightroom, and I can literally forget my DSLR and Laptop for a long time unless I require some heavy creative photography.Lastly, battery life is very good and it lasted me whole day with my heavy uses since I need to check and learn all the time, exploring the possibilities and potential of this beast. Charging too is very fast and 80% can be achieved in 30mins; then it slow down till 100%, which is ok for me. Till date no phone heating issue is observed while charging or during heavy uses. A14 chip works smoothly without any lag or hang as of now though I have not stressed it that far to rightly comment on that matter.Final verdict: Its an amazing product no doubt, but we in India are paying approx 50k more in taxes & duties to buy one if you compare the price outside of India - a pain point for person who looks for value for money product."
39,Yash  Choudhary,Brilliant in all aspects !,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Nothing to dislike!! This thing is a beast..in love with its design it looks perfect in hands !!
40,Kabir Debbarma,Screen should be tougher,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Round edges of iPhone 11 Pro Max feels much better than the flat edges, and screen doesn‚Äôt stay level if one play games on it like call off duty or pubg slight dimples appears on the screen also if one play pubg for more than 20 minutes the handset warms up."
41,vishal kumar,Defect,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The front speaker sounds very low. Why ??
42,Amazon Customer,Excellent,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazing machine: beautiful new design: if you can afford then go for it as it gives you a feel of super phone.
43,Sanjiv Bhatnagar,There is no phone like iphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  One of the best phone ever. Seamless performance no hick ups. Optical zoom is better than most other. Night photos are as good as daytime ones. Battery lasts a day on normal usage without playing games. Optional wireless charger is good n hopefully they will bring the fast charging ones soon. Importantly AppleCare + plan can be purchased within 60days of phone purchase which includes all technical support and damage including glass for two years but plan does not cover loss of phone. Bit pricy but well worth every penny.
44,Prashanth,Not worth the price.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used iPhone for 6 years and in-between for 3 years bought oneplus 6T, trust me iphone are just for craze. Repenting for buying iPhone 12 pro max 128gb which still uses out dated technology and features."
45,Sayantan ‚úÖ,Terrific Purchase! But too pricey!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The Best iPhone till date ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èBattery Life is good!Screen is awesome!!Cameras are best in the class!
46,Yashwant Kumar,It‚Äôs Smooth and fast,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Out of Five StarsBattery Life ****Screen ****Performance *****Sound *****Overall 4.5 StarsI have been using iPhone starting from 4s, 5s, 6s, 8 Plus and now iPhone 12 Pro Max. Transition is huge I must say. It‚Äôs fairly fast when I compare my 8 plus for obvious reason. Fast charging, battery back up, screen resolution, performance, Camera performance is top notch. I have seen so many reviews on YouTube and everyone kind of liked the phone but there is a very small difference between the performance of all iPhone 12 variants.  Definitely with naked eye comparing the performance is very difficult but for me it make sense because the chipset is same but capability wise every variant is different but still apple managed to match the performance and based on the requirement or specifications people are choosing their own iPhone 12 variant. With the same chipset and various capabilities across the variants the phone does not seem to give any performance issue.Overall my feedback is, definitely this mobile is capable enough but the price is not justified even if I got 14k discount."
47,sujeet mathur,I phone like nothing in this world,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I phone is the best phone
48,Manoj Parekh,Beast phone!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have upgraded from iPhone X. There's nothing much you can ask for this phone does it all and its a beast. The screen size slightly felt big for a day or two but I got used to it. Camera on this phone is something which really stands out and also the battery is very good. Easily I get 7 hrs of screen on time. If budget is not a problem it is better to get the pro max than pro variant. Overall its a great upgrade!

51,Amazon Customer,Happy with the purchase.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First time using an iPhone. Personally, really enjoying the phone.Display is good, notch is not that bothersome (for me).Battery life is not the best in the market but comfortably lasts a day, day and a half of regular use.Some heating where the cpu is during intensive use, but usually it won‚Äôt be a problem.Camera is the best in the business. The photos come out really well if you know your way around the settings. Videos are excellent.Definitely pricier than it should be. But considering the build quality and guaranteed updates, if you take care of it, it‚Äôll comfortably last 5+ years.I personally never had a moment where I went, ‚ÄúDamn I wish I had an android right now‚Äù but everyone‚Äôs different. This phone is more than good enough for my daily use as a student."
52,Sai Dhruv,"Well, it‚Äôs an iPhone.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall a good phone. Was a bit disappointed with the performance of the ultra wide camera when people are in the scene. I wish it offered a mode to remove the distortion. However, that‚Äôs nitpicking. If you want to have some of the cutting edge or the bleeding edge features, there are other brands. But if you want a matured phone with everything as it should be, go for an iPhone."
53,anju v.,Well it‚Äôs an iPhone..,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you can afford it please go for it.It‚Äôs a device which does it for you. Sometimes being provided with too many choices is confusing I felt that‚Äôs what is happening with android according to me. iOS is a butter like experience. Within a few weeks of using it I got used to the whole thing it makes your choices amd I like that. And the whole ecosystem is just mind blowing. With an iPad an iwatch airpods and MacBook you actually understand why the whole ecosystem is so addictive. It‚Äôs the best thing out there for a commoner, only if it was affordable.Sadly it‚Äôs not. There are better products out there that outperforms apple products individually but together the whole ecosystem is no match to any other in my opinion."

166,rajvir,Useless features and not vaule for money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not a valueable product.. Because there are lot of mobiles better than this.. The features that are promted by apple has nothing to do with your day to day life, all the features that it has are also available in any mid range phone .. It is just a piece of showoff and luxury..."

168,Atul,Good,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This product is good but NOKIA 3310 is the best than this u feel so different when using NOKIA instead of this iphone pro max.
169,Aditya,Everything you need to know,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let‚Äôs just be honest for a moment if you are buying a phone worth a lakh or more you will not think twice about buying a charger separately...Also the phone has amazing Camera, the best in class videos the display is just brilliant and the video and picture watching experience is goodAs it comes with stereo speakers the sound is incredible ( had put the phone under water while playing music and still it was loud enough)No doubt in performanceOnly complaint is about battery, as the display is bigger and better than ever before so slight improvement needed therePS: I don‚Äôt like to use case or screen guard on the phone but wouldn‚Äôt risk on this one as its not scratch proof at all , frankly it got more scratches than my iPhone Se (2nd Gen)Peace out ‚úåüèª"
170,Aaron d.,Im just happy even tho i had to sold my kidneys for this,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is just a bomb. big display and battery. the real issue is its 60% more than its release price. its all thanks to falling INR, import duty and tax over everything. The real problem is it is 1.4Lakh rs while average people earn 30k rs per month. While outside india (eg. U.S) the price is $1,100 while average people earns $5,000 per month. so if youre in U.S you can just get an iphone and live accordingly with rest money. but in India , youll have to take the entire salary + sell your kidney + borrow extra money to live after everything.I suggest to get a phone like this after settling outside or be ready to donate some organs."

177,kris,The sweet Apple üçé pie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This review from an ardent Android user for the past 10 years I've been using Android phones all along, I thought of going with Apple because of Android update problem oh yeah I have made great decision and this phone speaks volume the performance is absolute top-notch. It  is just above the rest in the market, people can argue that Apple is charging premium price for the product but compare the top of line Android smartphone which is like 10% to 15% lesser than I phone but with iPhone you get software support for atleast 4 years minimum, higer resale value then anyother top Android phone, more processing power and greater camera specialy with videos.So if you are looking for a great phone and willing to shell some extra penny then definitely iphone is the one you need to get.  Though I have written this review for iphone 12pro max, all the other 12 series phone reflect the same."
178,kumar pushpam,Worth as one kidney,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I got this iPhone 12 pro max after getting my kidney sold. It's a nice phone. The only problem is that sometimes my stomach hurts. ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
179,InvestBooks,Justifies the Premium Price that it deserves,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Before buying this everybody knows its premium and takes more money than a normal smartphone.The reason for the premium cost is iPhone really long last and gets regular iOS updates.Switched from 1+ Android to iPhone Pro Max. Used 5% full cash back using Amazon ICICI card instead and got around 6K instead of HDFC card max Rs 1750 instant discount.Every one knows the Pros. But I will highlight few issues and Bad about iPhones.1. Packaging was perfect. After a day of setup I noticed a small gap at the top right corner between panel and Contacted Apple support for the same and confirm its not defective.Google' d about this and many iPhone, iPads has this gap for various/Obvious reasons.2. No Charger and also Quick charge is not Quick (just for battery longevity).3. App migration is easy  but not smooth as switching from iOS to android4. Still stuck with WhatsApp migration (due to WhatsApp encryption its not straight away).5. Apple support via chat / phone is really excellent6. Heavy on Hand and wallet :-)Overall Android user will find it bit difficult to adapt iOS for a short time.."
180,Bonajit Kumar Patowary,Apple's Superphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Model: iPhone 12 Pro Max (256GB) - Pacific BlueAs always, it packs with the best display, best camera and best interface.But the battery backup is the cherry on the cake, the trolls for iPhone battery issues will finally come to an end.The only issue I am facing is the lack of touch id, as face id doesn't work with the mask on, even on trying with the multiple ways as shown on the internet.Overall it is a perfect super-phone.If anyone have a  budget, iPhone 12 pro max is the one, you should go for."

191,Alok Pandey,A great phone **,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this device for almost 5 months now. Iphones from the very onset have been about performance and getting tasks done rather than gimmicks. Camera even though 12 mp is best in class. Display and audio quality are immersive and impressive. Call quality has been good. Enabling e sim drains battery a bit much more quickey imo.** Honestly, unless u want a big size iphone that can create a 3-D map of object around you,  you don't need to go for 12 pro max go for iphone 12. It ticks most of the boxes at almost half the price."

If you want to do - Play games, watch movies, listen music etc etc- this phone produces best feature in every case. There is one problem though: Friend is no more :"

261,Prakhar,The Gold King of smartphones 2020 - 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Paisa vasool phoneMind-blowing phone i have no words for it.

262,Krushna,The best iPhone with the best design,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been into apple ecosystem since iPhone 4s.Since Apple started to move to larger displays they eventually let go the square design which I was missing a lot and did not hope that It ll ever comeback.The time when I saw they are bringing back the squared flat design I was blown away.I pre-ordered from Amazon as soon as it was available.Thanks to amazon I got the delivery on 14th.As soon as I unboxed it I was like wow.The phone feels ultra premium in hand with stainless steel borders and matte finish back.The display lives upto the standards of Apple.Battery life is at par with last year iPhones,though on paper it has a smaller battery.Coming to the camera samples it is again the best camera in a smartphone curretly.The 10bit HDR video is amazing.They have incorporated sensor shift stabilization which I am yet to test.Some of the pros and cons :Pros :DesignLow light camera shotsHDR VideoBattery lifeA14 5nm bionic chipCons:Price is relatively high compared to other marketsNo Charging adapter(might be a huge letdown for people newly moving to iOS)No high refresh rate displays(Although the display does not feel slow )What I felt :I upgraded from 11 Pro Max.For an average user you ll not find a huge difference in terms of overall usage and experience.The size might not be a fit for everyone since its really huge.I am yet to test the magsafe accessories as these aren't available on Amazon yet.So if some one looking to upgrade from iPhone XS or older ,will be a huge upgrade in terms of camera ,performance,battery life etc.Overall,its actually the best iPhone with the all time fav design WITH AN ULTRA PRO MAX PREMIUM COST :p(I ll add camera samples and edit this review after few months of usage)"

268,Jayant,My first iPhone ever,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I‚Äôve been an android user forever and very honestly this is my first iPhone ever. Are there things that can be better, definitely there are and there will always be. That being said is this one of the best phones I‚Äôve ever had, I would say definitely yes. Everything about it is very intuitive, fast and well put together. Could this phone have been more reasonably priced, definitely yes but no one flashed their iPhones or ‚Äúi‚Äù anything because they were so cheap to buy and maintain. There are a lot of things done well and a couple of them are the camera and battery, yes you heard me right the battery in this phone is amazing. I am a heavy user my screen remains on for the better part of 8-10 hours a day and I get on an average 30-45 calls everyday but I end up charging this phone only once in 2 days."
269,deepa hans,"Imma be honest, I am broke as hell",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The taste is good but this company just cheadep with us by it's cheap marketing process. The information mentioned in the discription is just teap of the ice bark it also contain vanilla flavour,salt and tocopherol even don't know what the think isü§®ü§®üò†.Not only this it contains 20.90g sugarüò±üò±ü§Ø which is probably 7 tab. Spoon üò°üò°üò° I think it don't the difference of sugar and jaggery. It will just put on some weight and colastroal and negligible amount of only 3.22g and 9.78g protein.This product is no way different from an of the Market product good for nothing dab for everything.
